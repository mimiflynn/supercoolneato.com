summary: Favorite Podcasts from the Road
---

I recently drove a lot of miles (3600) in 7 days and listened to a lot of podcasts which led to a lot of thoughts.

The episodes that really struck me on this journey trended along (minus the Ologies episodes) analyzing what one believes, why one believes it, how to live with those beliefs and how beliefs impact the people around us. How can I identify what I was taught in the past that still impacts me so I can move forward? How can I reconcile political differences with the people I love? How can one effect change in the world?
