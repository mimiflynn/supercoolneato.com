Subways and airplanes have been my major listening locations in addition to the office this month. Airplanes have been made much more enjoyable with my Shure SE846's with Comply P-series tips in conjunction with the Fiio X7 as a source.

The Shure SE846's are amazing. I didn't think I could get this kind of clarity on all levels with an IEM. The P-series tips really isolate the music from jet engine or subway sounds creating a wonderful bubble of musical joy all around my head.

The Fiio X7 is my first Android device. It compelled me to venture away from the iTunes eco-system for a moment, so I've signed up for Tidal. So far so good. The sound is crisp and precise with the AM2 amp module installed to power my more hungry headphones. I could swap it out and go with the IEM amp module instead, but I like the more fun sound signature of the AM2 more at the moment.
