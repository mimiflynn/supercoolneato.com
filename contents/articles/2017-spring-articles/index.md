I've not been listening so much to music lately. Listening to the city and reading has recently replaced music time. I don't believe this will be permanent, but instead of contributing recent albums I've been into, I offer you a few of my favorite articles.

Some of these are fairly old that I've recently revisited, and others are recent and have drawn me in for a second or third read.
