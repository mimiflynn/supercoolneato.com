[Slow Burn](http://www.slate.com/articles/slate_plus/watergate.html) - Definitely start with season 1

[Love + Radio](http://loveandradio.org/category/episodes/) - My favorite episode is [Bride of the Sea](http://loveandradio.org/2015/08/bride-of-the-sea/)

[Risky Business - weekly infosec news](https://risky.biz) - If infosec on its own doesn't interest you, perhaps this interview could pursuade you: [Bob Lord, CSO, Democratic National Committee](https://risky.biz/510_feature/)

[Uncivil](http://www.gimletmedia.com/uncivil) - All are good, but if you want an example of what makes this podcast great: [The Deed](http://www.gimletmedia.com/uncivil/the-deed#episode-player)

[ON THE CLOCK A (BRIEF) HISTORY OF TIME](https://www.backstoryradio.org/shows/on-the-clock-4/) - its just so interesting
