I'm back to scouring Internet Artchive for the best live shows I've not already discovered:


[Spoon - Live at Treasure Island on 2007-09-16](https://archive.org/details/spoon2007-09-16.flac16) is a very good binaural recording. Listen with headphones if you don't have an ideal stereo setup.


[Death Cab for Cutie Live at Street Scene - Best Buy Stage on 2005-07-30](https://archive.org/details/dcfc2005-07-30.at831.flac16) is a very good recording especially for being at an outdoor stage.
