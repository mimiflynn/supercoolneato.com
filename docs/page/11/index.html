<p>I’ve been in Austin part of this month and listening through my travel headphone rig: the amazing <a href="http://www.theaudiophileworld.net/2012/04/sennheiser-hd380-professional-review.html">Sennheiser <span class="caps">HD</span> 380 Pros</a> paired with my trusty old <a href="http://www.whathifi.com/audioengine/d1/review">Audioengine D1</a>.</p>
<p>The lightweight and noise isolating nature of the <span class="caps">HD</span> 380 Pros is why I favor them for long days working from coffee shops. As an added bonus that they come with a case that the ‘phones fold flat into and fits nicely in my computer&nbsp;bag.</p>
<p>My favorite feature of the D1 is its volume pot. Digital stepped up volume controls on computers tend to bother me. I want to control my volume in a more tangible&nbsp;way.</p>

<p>A lot of time went into planning my dream stereo, which is to say that I spent a good deal of time researching in the vortex of WhatHiFi?, Reddit, and Stereophile. In the end, I was able to source most of the components refurbished or open-box b-stock for just under&nbsp;2k.</p>
<p>“2000 for a stereo?” you might be asking me in you mind? Well, I had just come into some money by winning the <span class="caps">NYC</span> apartment lottery (AKA getting a buy out on my place) and figured I would treat myself to the sound system I always dreamed&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>Yes, it has been worth it. For the past year, any day I’m at home, this stereo is quietly or not so quietly playing in the background. It has proven to be one of my most favorite&nbsp;things.</p>
